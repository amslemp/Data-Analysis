# Purpose

This was a simple ad hoc analsyis for the Academic Vice President. He called one afternoon to see what the proportion of students was from a specific program that took all their classes online. This is akin to a business wanting to know the proportion of their clients who buy specific lines of products. Within an hour or so, the code for this was written and vetted. The great part was after the code was written, all I need to do is change out the major and the dataset to examine different majors for current or future semesters.
