# Data Analysis

This repository contains the python code for the high level data analysis I have done for VPs, Executives, and Directors that is typically the result of ad hoc requests. 
What I love about these requests is they typically ask me to do things that were not on my radar before. Many non-data analysts/scientists have the most interesting projects
and proposals for my time. I love tackleing these requests for them and will typically be able to knock most of them out in a matter of minutes to a few hours at the most. 
For non-data people, every requests seems cumbersome. I always assure them that it is not. 
For the VP I work with more than anyone, I always tell him, "The answer is always, 'Yes.' It is just a matter of time, expertise, and access to the data." I have another
repository that demonstrates my ML applications, predictive analytics, and forecasting models. 

## Data Collection

The Python code references csv files that I have gathered from a Banner DB, which is a product of Oracle. I write scripts in PL/SQL to pull the data. From there, I move 
over to Python. For ML tasks, I use a combination of R and Python, depnding on the task.
