# Consulting Group Analysis

The college looked into hiring a consulting group for a specific set of programs. The analysis titled *Major Analysis for Consulting Group* is a broad overview of the last several years of the programs. It is meant to give trends of GPA distributions, age distributions, contour plots, average credit hours taken, and the percentage of seats filled for each class. Seats filled is a contribution margin analysis with the goal of having more seats filled for each class each year. In theory, this reflects better gross profits (revenue - COMS or rev - cost = gross profit). The seats filled is a simple equation:

$$\frac{\text{seats enrolled}}{\text{seats available}} = \text{percentage of seats filled}$$

The *Trends in Majors* helped set the bar for what the consulting group was shooting for. The group was promising 15 new students to this particular set of programs. The problem is, this did not account for the loss and gain of students that happens every semester. For instance, each semester, a program could have 80 students at the end of Spring, lose 30 of those students, and then gain back 45, which would be $80 - 30 + 45 = 95$. This would be a net gain of 15 students. But suppose the program usually goes through that type of contraction and expantion but this year it loses 20 and gains 35 (i.e. $80 - 20 + 35 = 95$). That would still look like a "gain" of 15 when in reality it *gained* 10 fewer students compared to previous years! This is why the analysis I did and report I wrote up was so important to the VPs, President, and Board members, because it helped provide a clear understanding of what we expected if we concluded hiring the group was net positive. 

## Results

In the end, because of this analysis and the algorithms I wrote that allows us to quickly examine trends, we discovered this consulting group mischaracterized their effectiveness in a presentation to the board. Consequently, it saved the college $300,000 that the VPs, President, and Board were considering spending.
