# Purpose

The goal of this analysis is to delineate the workload between the Acadmic Advisors in the office. While office managers and students workers at each location enter students names for walk-in advising, academic advisors enter names of students they assist via phone, email, and Zoom. 

# The Data

The data was retrieved through the academic advising Teams website where the data is stored. Due to FERPA laws, the raw data files cannot be shared. In order to convert this data into structured data that can be examined in dashboards and algorithmic models, I applied a decent amount of programming and created several features that are non-native to the origianl dataset. 

# The Results

The output of this code is the datasets that are ready for analysis, data visualization, and data science.
