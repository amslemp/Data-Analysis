    "# Comparing Enrollment Of Previous Semester With Current Semester\n",
    "\n",
    "The main barometer of the successful efforts of the academic advising staff is whether *current* students reenroll for the next semester. Marketing and admissions are typically responsible for recruitment efforts. While this is not true at all Higher Ed institutions, it is true at most. Academic Advisors are responsible for making sure students understand school policies, are enrolled in the appropriate classes for their major, are taking courses in a strategic manner so as to knock out prerequisite courses first, and to help students learn how to balance personal, professional, and collegiate obligations. Typically, advisors do not have any direct impact on intake of *new students*. Since this is the case, I wrote the following algorithm to sort through students who were enrolled in the previous semester and compare them against the students who are enrolled in the current semester. When I first wrote the algorithm several years ago, I quickly realized that we needed to be clear about which students we were reaching out to for enrollment in the current semester from the previous semester. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Eligible Students**\n",
    "\n",
    "I realized that we needed to be clear about who the *eligible* students from the previous semester was. If I was not clear with that in my report to the Director of Advising and the VP of Enrollment Management, it would incorrectly communicate we had, say, 2700 students from one semester who had not enrolled when in reality we only 1500 *eligible* students who had not enrolled. There are some students who should not be in our list of *eligible* students. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, many colleges have an office that exclusively works with high school students--an office of High School Partnerships. Since there is an office that carries out that task, then high school students should be removed from the list because the academic advising staff is not responsible for those students. Every college also has a specific set of advisors who work with International Students. Given the myriad of laws these advisors are aware of and most follow, the general advising staff does not reach out to these students or have interaction with them. Therefore, international students are taken out of the mix. Every semester, some students graduate. These students, most of the time, are not continuing with the college. Therefore, to make sure that the outreach efforts reflect these students' accomplishments and graduation, they are removed from the eligible students who could enroll in the current semester. Finally, sometimes there are holds on students' accounts that prevent them from enrolling in the current semester--AR holds, Academic Suspension, TB Test Holds, and VP of Student Services holds. These students are also removed from the eligible students. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once these sets of filters are ran on the students from the previous semester as compared to those enrolled for the current semester, the final list can be pulled and distributed to advisors for outreach. This list shows the *eligible* students who have not yet enrolled for the current semester but were enrolled in the previous semester; it is used by the advising staff to try to encourage *current* students to reenroll for the new semester. These kinds of targeted outreach efforts have increased the persistence of continuing students up to 7% some semesters. "
