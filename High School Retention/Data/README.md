Data used for creating the dataframe will be stored in this file. Given the sensitive nature of the student data protected by FERPA laws, no data are actually stored here on Github. 

Data is pulled from Argos, an internal database management system connected to Oracle's Banner DB used by colleges and universities around the country. All Fall semesters will be stored as a .csv file.
