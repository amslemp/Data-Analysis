# Purpose

This was a simple task of feature engineering and then dashboard creation. The Dean over High School partnerships asked if we could track a specific cohort of students&emdash;those in their first semester right out of high school&emdash;and what their retention rate was the following Fall after their first Fall semester.

# The Data

The data was pulled from Oracle's Banner DB using PL/SQL. Since it is college data, the actual data cannot be uploaded due to FERPA laws. 

To get a sense of trends, I downloaded the data from that last five Fall semesters (when the request was made). The feature the Dean needed is non-native to the data but incredibly easy to generate. After creating this feature, I then isolated the students who are from this cohort and exported this data into a different program I have written to track retention. 

# The Model

After incorporating retention into the dataset, I integrated the data into a dashboard for the Dean and the Director of High School Partnerships so that they could make more strategic decisions with the students they work with as well as understand the population better.
